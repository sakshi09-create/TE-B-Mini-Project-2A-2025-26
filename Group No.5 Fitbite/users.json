                                "description": "i found an oatmeal pancake recipe that sounded really good but it wasn't gluten free. i changed and adapted it to suit my tastes, made it gluten free, and, voila! this is my favorite pancake recipe. it is hearty, heart-healthy, high protein, low glycemic and packs fiber for a satisfying breakfast that will carry you a long way.\r\n\r\nnote: the oats, milk and yogurt need to soak together for 8 hours before mixing in remaining ingredients.\r\n\r\nfreeze individual pancakes and you can reheat them in the oven (or microwave). using a moderate oven, i wrap 2 pancakes in foil and heat for about 15 minutes, no thawing necessary.\r\n\r\nthese make a great sandwich with your favorite nut butter. they are also great with your favorite jam, compote, syrup or combination topped with whipped cream!",

                                "description": "from \"the galt cookbook\", published in 1898. i have adapted it slightly, by adding quantities and instructions. to my complete surprise these remind me a little of \"lo bak go\", (dim sum popular at chinese new years.) the good ladies of galt are no doubt rolling in their graves, but i serve these with a good whack of chile-garlic sauce 'cause that's how i like my lo bak go too. these are not the sort of thing to make from scratch, but from the leftovers of a ham-and-potato meal. they are easiest to mix if the potatoes are still warm, so set them on to poach as you clean up after dinner. then, they can be fried up when you want them. keep cakes wrapped in the fridge until ready to fry. they will keep for a couple days, so you don't have to fry all of them at once. i should also note that i use an unsalted smoked ham, so you may wish to reduce or eliminate the salt if your ham is salted.",
